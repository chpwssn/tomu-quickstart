This example is a fork of miniblink that loosely implements FizzBuzz using the two LEDs on the Tomu.

This example demonstrates the following:
 * Configuring GPIO pins
 * Toggling GPIO pins
 * Controlling the system clock
 * Configuring a SysTick

Toggles the Red and Green LEDs on the board.
A SysTick interrupt is used to trigger LED toggling.
